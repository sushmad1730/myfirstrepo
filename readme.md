This is a sample for creating repo

this is for second commit on vs code

this is the change done directly on git, to update this in vs code we need to pull the code from this repo
-- used git pull origin branch_name to pull the data from repo 
-- git push origin branch_name to push the data 
-- git status :  it shows the status, modified or no change, upto date 
-- stage the changes : git add . (add all files)
 -- particular file : git add filename.extension
 --commit : git commit -m "Your message describing the change"
 -- git push origin main


 I AM WORKING IN NEW BRANCH NOW. 

 STEPS TO CREATE NEW BRANCH ON VSCODE

 1. CHECK BRANCH - git branch 
 2. CREATE BRANCH - git branch firstbranch 
 3. SWITCH TO NEW BRANCH - git checkout firstbranch (or) git switch firstbranch

 * TO CREATE AND SWITCH AT SAME TIME : git checkout -b firstbranch 

 4. PUSH BRANCH TO GITHUB: git push -u origin firstbranch
